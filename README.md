# VATGlasses Data Project
Airport and sector data for the VATGlasses project.

## Data Sets
VATGlasses is formed of lots of individual data sets. Each data set covers one (and occasionally multiple) countries, usually within the remit of a single vACC. Occasionally, a country is split into multiple datasets (e.g. if it is split across several divisions), but in most cases this should be avoided.

Every data set is contained within a separate file and the file structure is identical throughout. Some VATGlasses pages display multiple data sets at once and some data sets are displayed on multiple VATGlasses pages.

### Open-Source Data
This repository contains only **open-source** data - not all FIRs contained on VATGlasses are open-source. The current open-source data sets are:

#### Managed by Local Staff
- Germany (ED** and ET**). https://vatglasses.uk/centraleurope (@jannikvogel)
- Hong Kong (VH**, also contains Macau VM**). https://vatglasses.uk/hongkong (@Syntax505)

#### Managed by the VATGlasses Team
- Gibraltar (LX**). https://vatglasses.uk/ukireland
  - **N.B.** Gibraltar should remain separate from the UK set to allow it to be displayed on both the UK/Ireland and Iberia pages.
- Ireland (EI**). https://vatglasses.uk/ukireland
- South Africa (FA**, also contains Lesotho FX**). https://vatglasses.uk/southafrica
- United Kingdom (EG** and some overseas territories). https://vatglasses.uk/ukireland

### Closed-Source Data
Closed-source FIRs are managed by local VATSIM staff and are not open to public contributions. The current closed-sourced data sets are:

- Austria (LO**). _Pending Release_
- Moldova (LU**). _Pending Release_
- Norway (EN**). https://vatglasses.uk/norway
- Romania (LR**). _Pending Release_
- Slovakia (LZ**). _Pending Release_
- Spain (LE** and GC**). _Pending Release_

### New Data Sets
As a general rule, you should be local staff, an instructor, or (in small vACCs only) a mentor to add a new region to VATGlasses. This provides a point of contact for all future changes to the region and helps prevent incorrect information from making it onto the platform.

If you're a member of local staff looking to add your local vACC to the platform, feel free to open an issue with your name, vACC, and staff role. I'll get back to you as soon as possible (please also leave some contact info if you're not easy to find on the standard VATSIM channels). 

If you're not a member of local staff but you'd still like to contribute, please consider contacting the vACC directly - they may be very keen to have you on board! Alternatively, you could propose some improvements to an existing data set.
